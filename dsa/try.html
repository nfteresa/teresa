        <p class ="justified"> My name is Neil Francis A. Teresa a filipino citizen born in Manila and currently studying in University of the East Manila. I am a dedicated and passionate student of the university.
        I am currently 3rd year studying with a program of Computer Engineering in UE Manila. I live in Rodriguez, Rizal and currently staying in Manila because my school is far away from my home. My hobbies are playing sports like
        volleyball and badminton, playing online game like Mobile Legends,Valorant and etc. My ambition is too see myself as successful person and to work outside the country. I took this course because I am attracted in playing computer and 
        would like to continue my studies without making computer as hindrance.
